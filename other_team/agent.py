""" 
Description of the agent (approach / strategy / implementation) in short points.
This is a universal agent that works for both blue and red teams.
- It uses the __init__ method to define team-specific variables like enemy color, 
  flag tiles, and preferred directions for attacking and returning.
- The update() method uses these variables, allowing the same logic to work for either team.
- A simple random movement model is used, biased towards the current objective 
  (attacking the enemy side or returning to the home side).
